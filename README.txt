This is the README for an implementation of the rock, paper scissors game in Java.

Building the code:
You will probably have checked out the code from github using:
git clone https://github.com/richardmarston/rockpaperscissors.git
This will have created a directory called rockpaperscissors.
To build the project, change into the directory and run Maven:

% cd rockpaperscissors
% mvn clean package

The application can then be run using:

% java -jar target/RockPaperScissor.jar
